##Created a sort of "treasure hunt" game

Used HTML/CSS/Javascript to create this app.

The goal of the game is to escape from the killer, and get out of the woods alive!

To escape you must click on the boxes and find a ride to hitch and escape with your life.

The two ways to lose are:
1. Run out of turns before finding a ride, resulting in you being too deep into the woods and getting lost.
2. Clicking into a box that reveals the killer.
